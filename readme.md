## 2. Features

Our pizza menu project showcases the following key features:

- **Dynamic Pizza Components:** We utilize React props to create and render pizza components dynamically. This means that the pizza menu adapts based on the data provided, allowing us to easily add, modify, or remove pizzas from the menu without directly changing the code for each pizza.

- **Conditional Rendering:** Within our React app, we implement conditional rendering techniques to display the pizzas and their availability based on certain criteria. For example, we can show different messages for pizzas that are available, sold out, or coming soon.

- **CSS Styling:** In addition to React components, we employ CSS to style the menu and give it an appealing and responsive design. This ensures that the menu looks great on various devices, providing a seamless user experience.

## 3. Technologies Used

The project relies on the following technologies:

- **React:** As a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React forms the backbone of our pizza menu app. It enables the efficient creation of reusable components and allows us to manage the application's state effectively.

- **HTML and CSS:** We use HTML for creating the structure of the app and CSS for styling the menu components, providing an attractive and user-friendly interface.

- **Git:** We utilize Git for version control, enabling collaborative development and easy tracking of changes.

- **GitHub:** The project is hosted on GitHub, a platform that allows for easy sharing of code and collaboration with the community.
